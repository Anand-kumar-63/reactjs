position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position 

you can also write inline styles in javascript  by making an object and putting in the react element::  
stylesheet = {
  bgc:#fff;
}
const haeding = () =>{
  return {
    <div  style = {{bgc:#fff}}> hello I am a Heading </div>
  }
}
